        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: February 9, 2026</p>

        <h2>Agreement</h2>
        <p>By downloading or using Remember Who ("the App"), you agree to these terms. The App is provided by Lost Pines Creative LLC ("we", "us"), a Texas limited liability company.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>
        <p>Remember Who is a personal contact relationship manager. The free version includes core features with a contact limit. Premium features are available via one-time in-app purchase.</p>

        <h2>Your Data, Your Responsibility</h2>
        <p>You own all data you create in Remember Who. We do not claim any rights to your contacts, notes, transcriptions, or any other content. Because data is stored locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You are responsible for backing up your device</li>
            <li>If you delete the app or lose your device without a backup, your data cannot be recovered by us</li>
            <li>If you use optional cloud backup, your encryption credentials are your responsibility</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the App for unlawful surveillance or stalking</li>
            <li>Record conversations without consent where required by law (check your local two-party consent laws)</li>
            <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code from the App</li>
            <li>Redistribute or resell the App</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recording and Transcription</h2>
        <p>Remember Who includes optional voice transcription features. You are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws regarding recording conversations in your jurisdiction. Many states and countries require all-party consent for recording.</p>

        <h2>Purchases</h2>
        <p>Premium features are sold as a one-time lifetime purchase through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Refunds are handled by the respective store per their refund policies.</p>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We do not guarantee that the App will be error-free, uninterrupted, or that data will never be lost. We are not liable for any damages arising from your use of the App.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Lost Pines Creative LLC's total liability for any claims related to the App shall not exceed the amount you paid for the App in the 12 months preceding the claim.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>We may update these terms. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance. For significant changes, we will notify users through the App.</p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of Bastrop County, Texas.</p>
